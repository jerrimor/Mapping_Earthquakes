# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
In this project, the challenge was to create maps of earthquakes and their magnitudes using GeoJSON data. This map is built with Javascript and the layers and styling of the maps utilizes Leaflet.  The map covers earthquakes from all over the world from the past seven days. The GeoJSON data is pulled via an API through mapbox and returns geoJSON data to parse through and display on the map. Tectonic plates are also viewable to the user with the map.  Circle markers are utilized to pinpoint each earthquake and different colors are used to identify the magnitude of each earthquake. A legend is added for explanation of the color coding of the markers of each earthquake, as well.  

## Project Summary
The completed map has three base layers and three overlay maps.  The users are able to switch between different views provided by Mapbox, of street, satellite and dark views.  The overlay layers add additonal information for the user to see. Tectonic plates, Earthquakes, and Major Earthquakes are the three types of overlays added.  The user has a toggle that can be accessed on the map to turn these overlay layers on or off.  Another added feature is a pop up window to display both the magnitude of the earthquake and its location.
